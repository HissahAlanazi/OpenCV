# OpenCV
In This repository talks about one of the tasks of the artificial intelligence path, which is OpenCV ,                                                                              
Using the Python language and the OpenCV library for facial recognition through images as well as through video.                                                                 

First, download Python and download a OpenCV library.

To download the library, use the command write :                                                                                                                                   
pip install opencv-python

Like this picture but I downloaded it before :

 I ran the code using a visual studio code program 

# The Result:
